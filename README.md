*For more information on what this generator can do for you, take a look at the [gulp plugins](package.json) used in our `package.json`.*


## libsass

Keep in mind that libsass is feature-wise not fully compatible with Ruby Sass. Check out [this](http://sass-compatibility.github.io) curated list of incompatibilities to find out which features are missing.

If your favorite feature is missing and you really need Ruby Sass, you can always switch to [gulp-ruby-sass](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-ruby-sass) and update the `styles` task in gulpfile accordingly.

## Options

- `--skip-welcome-message`
  Skips Yeoman's greeting before displaying options.
- `--skip-install-message`
  Skips the the message displayed after scaffolding has finished and before the dependencies are being installed.
- `--skip-install`
  Skips the automatic execution of `bower` and `npm` after scaffolding has finished.
- `--test-framework=<framework>`
  Either `mocha` or `jasmine`. Defaults to `mocha`.
- `--no-babel`
  Scaffolds without [Babel](http://babeljs.io) support. This only applies to `app/scripts`, you can still write ES2015 in the gulpfile, depending on what your version of Node [supports](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/).
